# Used Regression to predict the amount of water outflowing a Dam using data regarding the change in water level in the dam. The code is in Matlab.
Note: All the files are well documented and commented wherever I felt necessary

Run the file named WateroutflowingDam.m which does the following:
1. Loads the dataset DamWaterLevelData.mat and visualises it
2. Feature mapping for the Polynomial Regression
3. Learning corve for the Regression
4. Gives Error on the Test set
5. Uses the Cross-Validation set for selecting "best" lambda
